<h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">RFC 1796 <a href="#RFCS" class="xref">[RFCS]</a> was published in April of 1995.  At that time, it was clear that there was an &#8220;regrettably well spread misconception&#8221; that the label &#8220;RFC&#8221; implied &#8220;some level of recognition&#8221;.  That has not changed in the 23 intervening years.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Repairing the common perception of the significance of the &#8220;RFC&#8221; label is clearly a Quixotic endeavour.  Though dishonest, allowing or fostering misapprehensions about the significance of the label is prevalent.  The result being that the credibility rightfuly earned by high quality documents on the RFC Series is to varying degrees purloined and undermined by documents of lesser quality.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">The label &#8220;RFC&#8221; must not be used unless a certain standard is met.  Documents that do not meet the agreed standard might still be worthy of publication, but they should not be granted the same label.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">The Internet Standards Process <a href="#RFC2026" class="xref">[RFC2026]</a> describes a process that has consistently produced quality documents.  This document proposes an experiment that limits the use of the &#8220;RFC&#8221; label to the product of that process.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#the-misconception" id="the-misconception">The Misconception</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">Misconceptions about the significance of publication as an RFC is commonplace.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">For example, ZRTP <a href="#RFC6189" class="xref">[RFC6189]</a> was published as an informational RFC on the IETF stream after the IETF reached consensus to publish DTLS-SRTP <a href="#RFC5764" class="xref">[RFC5764]</a> for the same use case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Similarly, HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) <a href="#RFC8216" class="xref">[RFC8216]</a> was published on the Independent Submissions Stream in defiance of a standardized protocol, MPEG-DASH <a href="#DASH" class="xref">[DASH]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">Both describe de-facto standards, each of which are implemented in more than one product and deployed.  Both are also highly contentious in their own field.  Neither can claim to be standards, but both happily claim to be RFCs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">Both have a stable presence on the Internet where specifications are published (<a href="http://zfoneproject.com/zrtp_ietf.html">http://zfoneproject.com/zrtp_ietf.html</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/streaming/">https://developer.apple.com/streaming/</a> respectively).  Indeed, both websites publish links to updated specifications (<a href="#ZRTPBIS" class="xref">[ZRTPBIS]</a> and <a href="#HLSBIS" class="xref">[HLSBIS]</a>).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#why-publish-as-rfc" id="why-publish-as-rfc">Why Publish as RFC?</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">So why is the publication of an RFC so keenly sought?  As someone recently said:</p>
<p></p>

<ul class="empty"><li>If they weren&#8217;t labelled &#8220;RFC&#8221; nobody would care about them.</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">So clearly the label carries some significance.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">If the label &#8220;RFC&#8221; were not important, you might seek a more principled reason for publication.  It might be reasonable to say that the goal is to create a stable, referenceable specification for a technology that might be of interest to the Internet community.  This view is consistent with the rationale given in the Section 2 of <a href="#RFC4846" class="xref">[RFC4846]</a>, which formalized the Independent Submissions Stream.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">For the examples given, the principled reasons for publication appear to be justified.  The former document is the by-product of the IETF, the latter a use of an IETF protocol.  While neither represents IETF consensus, the claim is undeniably true.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.6">However, it&#8217;s not obvious that this goal is not already accomplished by publishing specifications on a web site.  The only question is one of stability, a problem solved by the Internet Archive (<a href="https://web.archive.org/">https://web.archive.org/</a>).  That remains even if the Internet Archive did not already show that the sites for the identified specifications have been available and stable for an extended period.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.7">On the other hand, using the label &#8220;RFC&#8221; fosters the misconception that these documents hold some special status.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.8">ZRTP in particular demonstrates the significance of labelling. Recent specifications adopted by IETF working groups cite RFC 6189 normatively.  This suggests that even those most likely to understand the relevance of the status of an RFC have attributed greater credibility to this RFC than is due.  This is not supported by widespread deployment of ZRTP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.9">Of course, the potential for misconceptions about provenance is not limited to documents within the RFC series.  Claims that Internet-Drafts speak for the IETF are still commonplace, but there is no risk of an Internet-Draft being mistaken for an RFC from its name alone.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.10">Even assuming that the Internet is improved by enabling interoperation on alternative protocols, if that were the goal, that would be achieved by publication on a web site.  However, it&#8217;s more likely that alternative protocols fracture markets, make products more complex and expensive, and overall do more harm than good.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.11">The primary benefit in documenting alternative protocols is in capturing aspects of their design, so that techniques might be examined and learned from.  None of that depends on using the label &#8220;RFC&#8221;.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#the-value-of-consensus" id="the-value-of-consensus">The Value of Consensus</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">The reputation associated with the label &#8220;RFC&#8221; derives largely from the quality of the documents published under that banner.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">The quality of RFCs varies, as might be expected when there are more than 8000 documents.  Whether or not a document is officially a standard, the value of a protocol specification derives from its ability to codify agreement.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">The stated preference of the IETF for &#8220;running code&#8221; is based on a desire to have its output match reality.  Ideally, an RFC describes both an agreement in principle and an agreement with the protocol as deployed.  That the RFC Series contains a significant number of such documents is why the reputation associated with &#8220;RFC&#8221; label is so strong.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">At publication, some RFCs might only codify an agreement in priciple, with an intent to deploy.  That is a weaker state, but this might be a temporary condition as the protocol is eventually rolled out.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.5">In either case, the value of an RFC derives more from the agreement it represents than from its manifestation as a number attached to a document.  If the agreement exists, there is value.  This value does not depend on the label that is applied.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> <a href="#why-publish-ietf-consensus-as-rfcs" id="why-publish-ietf-consensus-as-rfcs">Why Publish IETF Consensus as RFCs?</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">Publication as an RFC comes with a number of limitations that do not all act in service of the goal of documenting agreement.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">The format is restrictive, even arcane, recent improvements <a href="#XML3RFCv3" class="xref">[XML3RFCv3]</a> notwithstanding.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">The immutability of an RFC is both restrictive and cumbersome.  Errors are impossible to correct, and the errata process is a poor method for recording necessary amendments.  This creates a tendency toward caution in the hopes of committing to an error.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">Even an approved document can take considerable time to be allocated an RFC number.  Of the 119 documents currently awaiting publication (see <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/current_queue.php">https://www.rfc-editor.org/current_queue.php</a>), 26 have been waiting for a year or longer, and the median time is 3 months.  Even disregarding missing references, which is the primary reason for delays, at the median, publications have been waiting 41 days to be published.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.5">The best reason to publish an RFC is because that is how the IETF codifies agreement.  That an RFC captures the conclusion of the Internet Standards Process is valuable because that process is valuable.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.6">The IETF could choose to publish via other means.  The IETF also has a website.  But there is an expectation that the IETF publishes RFCs.  To diverge from that would - at a minimum - be a violation of that expectation.  If the goal is to reconcile reality with perception, establishing a new document series would be in direct opposition to that goal.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> <a href="#have-rfc-mean-consensus" id="have-rfc-mean-consensus">Have RFC Mean Consensus</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">Reserving the &#8220;RFC&#8221; label for those documents that are the product of a consistent process is the most effective way to align perception and reality.  The Internet Standards Process <a href="#RFC2026" class="xref">[RFC2026]</a> is the obvious process to use.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">It&#8217;s true that the Internet Standards Process isn&#8217;t perfect and it cannot guarantee a particular level of quality.  But quality is less important than fidelity.  The Internet Standards Process is the best means we have for reaching and documenting agreement.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">Reserving the RFC Series for the publication of products of the Internet Standards Process would align reality with perception.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> <a href="#new-labels-for-other-documents" id="new-labels-for-other-documents">New Labels for Other Documents</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">The IETF publishes informational and experimental documents.  The expectations around what level of agreement is necessary to publish these documents is far less than those that it publishes on the standards track and so these documents should use other labels.  This is especially true for documents that don&#8217;t represent the consensus of the community, such as <a href="#EFFECT" class="xref">[EFFECT]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">The IETF publishes best current practice (BCP) documents that describe its own processes.  These don&#8217;t codify agreement about a protocol inasmuch as they don&#8217;t describe something implemented in software.  They do follow the same processes and require similar levels of agreement.  Use of the RFC label for BCP documents is appropriate, though there is no inherent reason not to use another label, particularly if other labels are created for documents from different sources.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">Similarly, the IRTF and IAB produce documents that do not represent an agreement in the same way.  These documents should use other labels.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">The possible exception to this are the documents produced by the Crypto-Forum Research Group (CFRG).  If it is considered important to publish CFRG documents with the &#8220;RFC&#8221; label, then it should be possible to attain IETF consensus for publication in the RFC Series.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.5">The Independent Submissions Editor also currently publishes RFCs.  These documents should use different labels.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8">
<a href="#rfc.section.8">8.</a> <a href="#nothing-short-of-a-new-label-works" id="nothing-short-of-a-new-label-works">Nothing Short of a New Label Works</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">Almost every RFC published in the last 35 years contains a prominent &#8220;Status of this Memo&#8221; section.  Recent documents include a markings in the header, signifying the stream and status (or category).  In addition, the most widely used source for RFCs, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/">https://tools.ietf.org/html/</a>, uses a colour-coding scheme to highlight the status of documents.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">This clearly hasn&#8217;t worked.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.3">The use of subseries labels like &#8220;STD&#8221; have been ineffectual (see <a href="#std" class="xref">Appendix A</a>).  The BCP subseries has been more effective, perhaps because of the greater familiarity of its primary audience with its meaning.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.4">It&#8217;s possible that with a move to presenting RFCs in HTML rather than text, new methods of signaling status could be developed.  For instance, using colour-coding to represent origin and status, or rendering documents that aren&#8217;t on the standards track using Comic Sans.  This ignores the fact that the choice of rendering is not part of the canonical XML document.  Alternative renderings could legitimately erase that information.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.5">That leads to the conclusion that better labelling, while possibly helpful, would not be sufficiently effective in correcting misconceptions.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9">
<a href="#rfc.section.9">9.</a> <a href="#no-change-to-existing-documents" id="no-change-to-existing-documents">No Change to Existing Documents</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">There is no point in revising existing documents.  These documents were published with an expectation of immutability.  Thus, any attempt to relabel these would be limited to changing document metadata.  That has already proven to be ineffectual.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">Any misconception that might exist in relation to existing documents is therefore irreparable.  There is no rational means of retracting the issuance of RFC numbers for the hundreds of documents that might need to be assigned new labels retrospectively.  The simplest thing to do is to not worry about this problem.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.10.p.1">The use of new labels has been proposed as an experiment.  An experiment ends when you have accumulated enough evidence to support or disprove the hypothesis.  In this case, the hypothesis being that publication as RFC is sought more for the ability to acquire the label than any principled reason.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.2">The proposed experiment changes just one variable: the choice of label for newly published documents.  The challenge is in measuring the effect of that change.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.3">This document proposes several tests, most of which rely on observations about the Independent Submissions Stream.  This stream is chosen because of its independence from the IETF stream and for the relative volume of publication, which historically exceeds that of the IAB or IRTF streams.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.4">As has been said about this experiment in relation to the Independent Submissions Stream:</p>
<p></p>

<ul class="empty"><li>Most likely, the new series would be devalued and would fade away.</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.6">If this is true, and the value of publication as RFC derives largely from the label, then it should be possible to observe the effect of the experiment on that stream.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.7">In the first test, the rate of requests for publication on the Independent Submissions Stream over time is recorded.  If the introduction of the experiment causes the number to drop relative to longer-term trends, then we have some information about the reasons for seeking publication.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.8">The second test will record the number of documents published by the Independent Submissions Editor (ISE) using the new label.  A drop in this rate relative to that of those documents published with the &#8220;RFC&#8221; label could also indicate that a change of label has some effect.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.9">The rate of submissions to that stream is not generally very high, meaning that any measurement is susceptible to noise.  There is also the potential for novelty effects to drive up demand in the short term.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.10">Aside from these concrete measures, it is certain that copious amounts of anecdotal evidence will be brought to bear.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.1">The assignment of documents to the &#8220;STD&#8221; subseries has been ineffective.  The label &#8220;STD&#8221; is effectively invisible and irrelevant.  For most purposes, a document at the level of Proposed Standard is adequate.  Indeed, it is often remarked that the Internet runs on Internet-Drafts.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.2">This is not a new observation <a href="#ONESIZE" class="xref">[ONESIZE]</a>, but time has not diminished its relevance.  This is likely due to the relative difficulty of progressing a specification to Internet Standard.  As of the time of writing there are 81 documents designated as STD.  New entries are added a rate generally not exceeding 5 in a year by date of RFC publication, with the exception of 15 RFCs published in 1983.  Given that there are approximately 300 RFCs published each year, the rate of progressing to Internet Standard is extremely low.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.3">Of course, some documents on the STD subseries are of questionable value on the modern Internet and some might be better with a Historic demarcation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.4">This document intentionally does not aim to address this with a more comprehensive set of changes.  Making multiple changes can compromise an experiment.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">This isn&#8217;t really a new position.  It&#8217;s a little embarrassing to find that all these arguments are merely a reiteration of arguments articulated more than a decade ago.  <a href="#NEWTRK-RFC" class="xref">[NEWTRK-RFC]</a> contains many of the same arguments.</p>
