Abstract

   The Independent Submissions series of RFCs serves a number of
   purposes.  This document examines the use of the Independent
   Submissions series: how it has been used, how it is currently being
   used, and how it might be used in the future.

Internet-Draft       Independent Submissions Future            June 2018


1.  Introduction

   The Independent Submissions Stream [IS] is one of the four streams of
   documents that together comprise the RFC Series [SERIES]:

   o  The IETF produce documents on the IETF Document Stream.  That
      stream is managed by the IESG [STD-PROCESS].

   o  The IRSG produce documents on the IRTF Document Stream.  That
      stream is managed by the IRSG [IRTF-STREAM].

   o  The IAB and its programs produce documents on the IAB Document
      Stream.  The IAB also manages that stream [IAB-STREAM].

   o  Any member of the community can produce a document on the
      Independent Submission Stream.  That stream is managed by the
      Independent Series Editor (ISE) [ISE].

   [SERIES] identifies that the community served by each stream is
   different.  This document examines the ways in which the Independent
   Submissions Stream differs from other streams in the RFC Series.

   This draft might, in a future version, make some specific
   recommendations regarding that stream.

2.  Independent Submissions Stream Functions

   The role and usage of the Independent Submissions Stream has evolved
   over time.  From its roots in informal publication of RFCs by Jon
   Postel, the Independent Submissions Stream (shortened subsequently as
   just "the stream") has since been formalized as part of the series.

   The formal definition of the stream gives the ISE considerable leeway
   in determining what is - or is not - published on the stream.  [IS]
   contains a lengthy list of potential reasons for publication of
   documents from the stream.  One goal of this document is to examine
   those uses, to determine which of the various reasons are seeing
   highest use, and to assess whether certain of these uses remain
   relevant to the future of the stream.

3.  Observations on Contemporary Use

   Since the publication of RFC 4845, where the role of the stream was
   more clearly defined, 198 documents have been published on the stream
   from a total of 321 [ISE-LIST].  This analysis will concentrate
   primarily on the 198 more recent documents.

Internet-Draft       Independent Submissions Future            June 2018


   Note:  [IS] lists numerous documents that are apparently published on
      the stream and not all of these documents are listed on
      [ISE-LIST].  This calls into question the accuracy of [ISE-LIST],
      but it is assumed that these errors only exist for older documents
      and that the list is substantively correct for those documents
      under analysis.

   Earlier documents include work that might today be attributed to the
   IETF stream.  For instance, RFC 3629 [UTF8] is an Internet Standard,
   but published on the stream.

   Excluding those published on the first day of April (see
   Section 3.1), these recent documents only include documents that are
   designated "Informational" (150), "Experimental" (21), and "Historic"
   (8).

   Several key motivations have been identified for the publication of
   documents on the stream.  This section examines several of those
   motivations and provides additional information and observation about
   several examples.

3.1.  April First RFCs

   Of recent documents, 19 were published on the first day of April.
   These are all of dubious technical value, but their intent is
   generally well understood.

   These 19 documents were not considered in any further analysis.

3.2.  Protocol Specifications

   The bulk of documents on the independent stream are protocol
   specifications.

   Determining the actual status of a protocol specification is
   challenging without investigating the details of each specification.
   For instance, without understanding the status of email deployment,
   some investigation is necessary in order to determine if [SIO-LABEL]
   enjoys deployment such that documenting its semantics was a valuable
   service to the email community, whether it describes a proprietary
   mechanism, or whether the exercise of publication was aspirational
   effort and the protocol has since never been deployed.  In this
   specific case, querying the authors reveals that the specification
   has a small amount of use.

   This section aims to identify some of the important ways in which the
   stream is used for the publication of protocol specifications.  It's
   likely that there are multiple reasons that motivate the publication



Thomson                 Expires December 27, 2018               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       Independent Submissions Future            June 2018


   of any single document.  Therefore, this section is not intended to
   be a taxonomy of reasons, but more an examination of reasons that
   might motivate publication.

3.2.1.  Vendor-Specific Protocols

   Documentation of vendor-specific or proprietary protocols is a common
   reason for seeking publication on the stream.  Some protocols are
   clearly identified as vendor-specific, to the extent of clearly
   identifying the vendor in the title (e.g., [RFC5517], [RFC6108],
   [RTMFP]) or abstract ([RFC7745]).

   The status of protocols can be difficult to determine.  Many
   documents are coy about making their proprietary nature obvious.  It
   is therefore impossible without significant effort to determine how
   many protocols published on the stream are in practice vendor-
   specific.

   [LIVE-STREAMING], [VP8], and [WIN-IMAGE] all describe proprietary
   protocols that are nonetheless implemented widely.

3.2.2.  Extensions to IETF Protocols

   Many documents on the stream describe extensions to protocols that
   were developed in the IETF.  As before, without investigating every
   protocol proposal, it's difficult to determine the status of these
   extensions and why these were not adopted by the IETF.

   In some cases, protocol extensions are published on the stream simply
   because the IETF did not have an active group of people working on
   the protocol.

   Work that was specifically abandoned by the IETF might be published
   by the IETF.  For instance, the DIME working group abandoned work the
   document that was eventually published as RFC 6159 [RFC6159] after
   being unable to reach consensus about the use case.

   Some documents were published on the stream even while the IETF has a
   working group active in the area that might otherwise have adopted
   the work.  This might be because the current charter of the group did
   not permit that type of work at that time, which is the case for the
   HTTPBIS working group in 2010 when RFC 5861 [RFC5861] was published.

   Similarly, while the 6MAN working group produced several standards
   track documents related to IPv6 flow labels, the publication of use
   cases in [RFC6294] was done on the stream.

3.2.3.  Predecessors to IETF Protocols

   Documenting a proprietary protocol that was a predecessor to a
   standardized protocol serves some historic interest.  Predecessor
   protocols are generally clearly labelled as such (see for example
   [RFC5143]).

   The stream also includes protocols that were not chosen for
   standardization, such as the NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP)
   [NAT-PMP].  NAT-PMP addresses a use case for which the IETF
   ultimately chose Port Control Protocol (PCP) [PCP].  NAT-PMP clearly
   identifies its successor and provides advice on transition.

   Note that the IETF sometimes publishes these documents on the IETF
   stream (for example, [SSLv3]).

3.2.4.  Alternatives to IETF Protocols

   Protocol alternatives have a variety of reasons.  Some are
   modifications to existing mechanisms [RFC5569].  Some aim to address
   a deployment environment that might vary from the one that IETF
   protocols target, such as [RFC8272] and [RFC7681].

   It's possible that proponents of solutions that were not selected for
   standardization by the IETF or other standards bodies could seek
   publication on the stream.  For a protocol that is widely deployed,
   documentation might aid interoperability.

   However, it is difficult to make an objective assessment of whether
   this is appropriate or whether publication of an RFC will result in
   discouraging investment in the standardized products.

3.2.5.  Protocols Abandoned by the IETF

   RFC 7069 [DECADE] describes the DECADE protocol.  This document was
   the primary goal DECADE working group, which closed before the
   publication of this document.  That working group produced two
   Information RFCs surveying the problem domain [RFC6392] and providing
   a problem statement [RFC6646], but did not complete their work.  In
   closing the working group, it was noted that the IESG had rejected
   some of the work of the working group [DECADE-CLOSE], but without
   further analysis of RFC 7069 it is not clear whether those concerns
   were addressed before publication.

   [RFC5690] describes work that might be undertaken by the TCPM working
   group in the IETF, or possibly the ICCRG.

Internet-Draft       Independent Submissions Future            June 2018


   Some number of the abandoned protocols that are published on the
   stream bear an IESG Note indicating this status.  Of recent
   publications on the stream, the IESG requested the addition of a note
   to 39 documents.  ([RFC5000] also bears a note, but this was omitted
   from this tally).

   Many earlier documents include an obviously pro-forma disclaimer in
   the IESG Note.  The last pro-format IESG Note appears in RFC 5707
   [RFC5707].  In 9 cases this pro-forma note explicitly indicates that
   the work was abandoned by the IETF.  Two recent documents in the
   stream were published from a draft with a "draft-ietf-" prefix.

3.2.6.  Protocols Rejected by the IETF

   Only 11 of the 127 documents published after RFC 5707 bear an IESG
   Note.

   Other than the pro-forma disclaimer, the reasons for including an
   IESG Note generally appear to be based on lack of consensus in the
   IETF regarding the specific protocol specification.  This can be a
   lack of consensus about use cases, as was the case with [RFC6159].
   This might be as a result of architectural concerns, such as with
   [RFC4938], or even concrete technical issues, such as with [RFC7943].

   Of particular note here is RFC 7974 [TCP-HOST-ID], which was
   published after the IESG identified a conflict under the terms in
   [CONFLICT-REVIEW] and requested that the document not be published by
   the ISE [TCP-HOST-ID-CONFLICT].

3.3.  Cryptographic Primitives

   Publication of cryptographic primitives - such as crytographic
   algorithms and protocols - is a major use of the stream.  Based on a
   rough count, 17 recent documents define key exchange protocols and
   algorithms, block ciphers, digital signature schemes, hash functions,
   and other cryptographic functions.

   In recent years, the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) group in the
   IRTF has taken a more active role in reviewing and publishing
   cryptographic primitives.  While it might be reasonable to expect
   that this would result in fewer publications of documents of this
   type on the stream, this does not appear to be the case.  3 of the 8
   documents published in 2017 were cryptographic primitives.

   The security community is increasingly aware of the need for academic
   review of cryptographic primitives.  It is not obvious from the
   annotations on published documents, but publication on the
   Independent Submissions Stream does not signify a particular standard



Thomson                 Expires December 27, 2018               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Independent Submissions Future            June 2018


   of review.  In comparison, the CFRG conducts extensive review of
   documents that are also published as "Informational" RFCs.

3.4.  Supplementary Information Related to IETF or IRTF Work

   IETF working groups often produce drafts that are useful in their
   primary tasks.  Documents that explore problem spaces, perform
   requirements analysis, or list use cases are commonly produced and
   then discarded in the process of building standards track documents.

   Several of these documents were published on the stream.  For
   instance, this is true of the aforementioned [RFC6294].  The same is
   true for RFC 6983 [CDNI-HAS], which the CDNI working group used as
   input to the CDNI framework [CDNI-FRAMEWORK].

   Some documents don't aim to define new protocols, but instead provide
   implementers of protocols more information or to provide valid
   alternative implementation strategies.  There are only a few of these
   documents.

   For example, [RFC7129] provides additional background and context
   regarding the use of NSEC and NSEC3 in DNSSEC.  [RFC7093] describes
   alternative implementation techniques for meeting the requirements of
   [PKIX].  [RFC6479] does the same for [IPSEC-IAH] and [IPSEC-ESP].

3.5.  General Interest Documents

   Several documents published on the stream contain information of a
   general nature.  This information might not be readily available
   elsewhere, or it might be tailored specifically to the usual audience
   of the RFC series.  This audience is presumably participants of the
   IETF and IRTF based on the content of these documents.  It is hard to
   identify an audience, because there are very few documents of this
   type in those recently published.

   These documents include an extensive security glossary [SEC-GLOSS],
   reports on events of potential interest [NAME-COLLISIONS],
   [SMART-OBJECT].

   The stream also includes documents related to the process of
   contributing to the IETF [RFC6417].  Some pertain directly to the
   mechanical process of producing RFCs [PANDOC], [MS-WORD].

3.6.  IANA Registrations

   A non-trivial number of documents published on the stream exist only
   to satisfy publication requirements for IANA registries.




Thomson                 Expires December 27, 2018               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       Independent Submissions Future            June 2018


   Of recent documents published on the stream, 76 of the 181 documents
   include IANA considerations sections that demand specific actions of
   IANA.

   This count might be inflated, as some documents contain IANA
   considerations that appear to make a request of IANA, but do not have
   concrete actions.  For example, [RFC5690] contains a list of
   codepoints that are specifically set to "TBD".

   Note:  Several RFCs published on April 1 request various actions,
      such as that in [RFC4041], but it is assumed that these do not
      stipulate actions under the IANA agreement, past or present.

   This suggests that a high proportion of publications on the stream
   exist to fulfill requirements for access to protocol codepoints.
   IANA policies such as "RFC Required" [IANA-CONS] would appear to
   provide undue incentive to publish an RFC (see Section 4.3.1).

3.7.  Unused Motivations for Publication

   A great many of the reasons for publication on the stream (see
   Section 2 of [IS]) are either infrequently used or have never been
   used.

   o  There is no apparent discussion of Internet-related technologies
      that are not part of the IETF agenda.

   o  Though [RFC6417] specifically addresses this point, there is
      little evidence that the stream is being used to published
      important new ideas as a bridge publication venue between academia
      and IETF engineering.  It's possible that the IRTF stream is
      fulfilling this need.

   o  Though [IS] makes a particular point of noting that critiques and
      discussions of alternatives to IETF Standards-Track protocols is
      important, no such critiques could be found in recent
      publications.  That is, unless an allowance is made for the
      oblique form of critique inherent in a full, alternative protocol
      specification.

   o  No editorials, eulogies, or policy statements made by the IANA
      were found in the recent documents of the stream.  One statement
      of RFC Editor policy appears in RFC 5744 [RFC5744], which appears
      to apply exclusively to the stream.

   This assessment is based on a review of recent documents, which was
   not entirely comprehensive, so there could be exceptions.

4.  Independent Submission Stream Problems

   The largest category from which publication on the stream is sought
   is for protocol specification.  Though it is hard to definitively
   point to specific motivations for each document, some trends are
   recognizable.  This section explores obvious trends and potential
   problems with the established pattern of publication on the stream.

4.1.  Protocol Specifications

   It is very difficult to assess the quality of protocol specifications
   that are published on the stream.

   This section aims to "teach the controversy" by summarizing the
   different viewpoints that are held as to the value of permitting the
   publication of protocol specifications on the stream.

4.1.1.  For Publishing Protocol Specifications

   Maintaining a record of the dialog on important subjects is
   important.  Documenting views that challenge orthodoxy provides a
   valuable service that the Independent Submissions Editor can provide.

   Documenting - and archiving - contrary views with the high editorial
   standards that the RFC editor provides is an important service to the
   community.  Documenting an alternative with an honest representation
   of its status and pointers to the alternative that has IETF
   consensus, as is done with [NAT-PMP] ensures that there little chance
   for confusion.

   There are examples of protocol specifications that were published on
   the stream that have since enjoyed wide deployment, even adoption and
   later revision by the IETF.  [[Editor's Note: This claim has been
   made in the context of older documents.  However, from documents
   published after [IS], the only document that has been moved to the
   IETF stream for a subsequent revision is [RFC5544], which was
   replaced by [RFC5955].  It's not clear that this media type actually
   enjoys wide deployment.]]

   The addition of IESG Notes to published documents serves as ample
   notice to readers about the status where the publication is of a
   dissenting voice.

4.1.2.  Against Publishing Protocol Specifications

   Publishing a document in the RFC series that directly conflicts with
   other documents in the series is unacceptable.  The credibility
   accrued to the series derives directly from the quality of the



Thomson                 Expires December 27, 2018              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       Independent Submissions Future            June 2018


   documents in the series and that credibility is largely a product of
   the rigorous consensus process applied by the IETF.

   The credibility of the series as a whole is undermined when protocol
   specifications are published outside of these processes.

   This is far less of a concern if documents honestly represent their
   contrary nature.  For instance, it seems unlikely that descriptions
   of vendor-proprietary protocols, if clearly labelled as such, would
   cause any such confusion.  In practice however, the level of
   technical maturity of ambiguously-labelled protocol specifications is
   very difficult to ascertain.

   Clearly conveying the status of a specification is inconsistent,
   especially for documents published on the stream.  For example the
   following documents all describe extensions to the SIP protocol that
   do not have IETF consensus: [RFC5806], [RFC6044], [RFC6143], and
   [RFC6189].  The first two were published on the stream, the latter
   two on the IETF stream as informational.  While all four contain
   indicators that suggest the true status of the work - the first
   contains an IESG note and Historic status - these documents are all
   confusingly similar to documents published on the standards track by
   the IETF.

   The effect on the architecture of the Internet of deploying protocol
   mechanisms is hard to determine.  No process exists to ensure that
   problems are identified in protocols prior to their publication on
   the stream.  Though IESG review might reveal these issues, for an
   IESG Note to be an effective defense against deployment of harmful
   protocols, the IESG conflict review process would need to be more
   comprehensive than the process in [CONFLICT-REVIEW] requires.

   For the IRTF, the same logic applies to cryptographic primitives
   Section 3.3 published on the stream.  [[Editor's Note: it's not clear
   whether there is any other IRTF work that has been similarly
   affected.]]  There is no history of protocol specification on the IAB
   stream.

   If the value attributed to the processes applied by the IETF, IRTF,
   or IAB streams do not apply, the only concrete value derived from
   publication are secondary: consistent copy-editing, format, and
   archival.  Indeed, many of these qualities could be ascribed to
   internet-drafts.  Even archival, where drafts are only deleted in
   extreme circumstances.

   There are many alternative venues for publication available to
   authors.  For example, protocols are routinely published on web

   sites, blogs, in public source code repositories, or as academic
   publications.

   Publication of an RFC ascribes a certain perceived status to both the
   material and author.  And it is this status that motivates authors to
   seek publication on the stream.  This does not serve to enrich the
   series.

4.2.  Lack of Maintenance for IETF Protocols

   Publishing protocol extensions for IETF protocols on the stream might
   indicate that the IETF is not providing an adequate venue for
   protocol maintenance.  This is seen for protocols with more narrow or
   specialized usage.  There are a significant number of documents
   published on the stream that were previously discussed in active IETF
   working groups.

   The ISE queue as of 2018-01-11 shows two PKCS#8 documents.  Work that
   would ordinarily fit into the domain of the SEC area in the IETF.

   Whatever the reason for the IETF not engaging with work, the use of
   the stream for protocol maintenance is not appropriate.  Protocol
   maintenance is a critical function and the IETF is responsible for
   the maintenance of the protocols that it publishes.  Failing to
   publish important updates, or failing to make hard decisions about
   the suitability of marginal updates, does the community a disservice.

   Often this is unglamorous work, but it is important that the IETF
   recognize that it has a responsibility to maintain its protocols.

4.3.  Excessively Strict Registry Policies

   Recent best practices on setting policies for IANA registries
   encourage more open policies.  In particular, RFC 8126 recommends
   that "[working groups] should select the least strict policy that
   suits a registry's needs" [IANA-CONS].  Recently, a number of
   registries have been updated to have more open policies.

   For instance, additions to the link relations registry establied in
   [LINKv1] never required the publication of an RFC.  However, several
   such documents were published in a short timespan on the stream:
   [RFC6892], [RFC6903], [RFC6906], and [RFC7089].  RFC 8288 [LINK]
   revised the process of registration to make this unnecessary and the
   process easier.

4.3.1.  The "RFC Required" Registry Policy

   Though used less frequently than alternatives, the "RFC Required"
   policy on IANA registries [IANA-CONS] is a particular problem.  It
   doesn't establish any requirements other than publication as RFC, so
   the natural path for acquiring a code point is to seek publication on
   the stream that has the easiest publication criteria.

   The "RFC Required" policy is often used inappropriately as a proxy
   for another property.  For example, if the intent is to require
   community consensus then "IETF Consensus", "Standards Action", or
   "IESG Approval" is clearly more appropriate.  Similarly, if the
   intent is to insist on a particular standard of documentation for a
   specification, then the "Specification Required" policy with
   additional guidance to a designated expert can achieve the same end.

   Deprecating or eliminating the "RFC Required" policy would remove
   pressure to publish documents on the Independent Submissions Stream
   purely to meet the requirements for obtaining protocol codepoints.

4.4.  ISE Discretion and Oversight

   The ISE retains significant editorial discretion over what is
   published on the stream.  As a single person, the ISE might exhibit
   bias.  In part, the Editorial Review Board serves to inform the ISE
   of the breadth of views that exist regarding particular technologies.
   The ultimate interpretation of that information is the responsibility
   of the ISE.  This is an enormous responsibility, which is exercised
   with negligible oversight measures.

5.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   If this contains meaningful content, then maybe that indicates that
   the content is necessary.
