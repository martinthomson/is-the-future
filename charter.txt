RFCs and Independent Submissions: Examination and Revision (RISER)

The RISER working group is chartered to investigate and document changes that
enable greater independence for the operation of the Independent Submissions
Editor. Minimally, this will involve creating a new label, other than "RFC,"
for the documents produced in the future on the Independent Submissions Stream,
and removing the conflict review process for those documents.

RFC 4846 defines the Independent Submissions Stream as a document stream within
the RFC series. However, that stream follows very different processes to other
streams. In particular, though the independence of the stream is valued as a way
to ensure that dissenting voices can find a platform that will reach the greater
IETF community, the publication of dissenting opinions on the stream creates
tension with other streams.

The tension between independence and this close relationship with other streams
in the RFC series is rooted in confusion about the status of documents. The RFC
series is dominated by the product of the IETF stream.  The properties of that
stream - that they are primarily the consensus of the IETF, and that they were
developed within the IETF - are widely assumed for all documents bearing the
"RFC" label.

The goal of the Independent Submissions Stream is to provide a venue for
publication of documents that seek the same audience as the rest of the RFC
series. This does not require that those documents bear the "RFC"
label. Designating a new label will remove any potential for confusion about
status.

The RISER working group will concentrate on a revision or updates to RFC 4846
and RFC 5742. Revisions or updates for RFC 4844 and RFC 6548 might also be
necessary. The working group will not change the ISE selection and oversight
processes. Nor will it make changes to the RFC label on any documents previously
published in the Independent Stream.
